# Hi, 
I am a dedicated and passionate individual who believes in the power of hard work and continuous learning. With each passing day, I strive to expand my knowledge and skills, embracing new opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. Joining your esteemed company would provide me with an ideal platform to further enhance my capabilities while contributing to the company's productivity and success. 
Following are the Projects that I have worked on recently:
# 1. EMBERSPACE
Emberspace is an exciting online 3D multiplayer first-person shooter game set in a captivating Outer Space theme. The game features lobby sessions connected through Steam and includes an innovative in-game NFT marketplace. Players are divided into two categories: Aliens and Elite Force.

In this immersive gameplay experience, scientists have created a highly potent missile capable of annihilating entire planets. The Aliens seek to capture this destructive weapon, while the Elite Force's mission is to defend the missile and eliminate all alien threats. Adding to the challenge, an AI-controlled celestial entity roams the game, mercilessly targeting any species that crosses its path.

As players engage in thrilling battles, they have the opportunity to complete specific in-game tasks, earning valuable NFT rewards. These unique digital assets can then be sold on platforms like OpenSea, allowing players to further enhance their gaming experience beyond the virtual world.

Emberspace offers an action-packed and strategic gaming environment where players can immerse themselves in intense battles, seize opportunities for personal progression, and even profit from their accomplishments in the vibrant NFT marketplace.

# 2. SnowBall Fight
Snowball Fight is a single-player third-person shooter game where players battle against AI-controlled bots using snowballs. There are several game modes to choose from, including Capture the Flag and Free for All.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each game mode:

Capture the Flag: 
In this mode, two teams of players compete to capture the other team's flag and return it to their own base. The first team to score a certain number of captures wins the game.
Free for All: 
In this mode, all players are on their own and must fight to be the last player standing. The player with the most kills at the end of the round wins.

# 3. Game of Life
Game of Life is a multiplayer card game that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Players can create or download their own cards as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be used in the game as cards with special abilities. The game uses NFT metadata to extract the images for the cards.

Here is a more detailed explanation of how the game works:

In Game of Life, players can use NFTs to create their own custom cards. These cards can have special abilities that can be used to give players an advantage in the game. For example, a card with the ability to "draw two cards" would give the player an extra turn.

The game uses NFT metadata to extract the images for the cards. This means that the images for the cards are stored on the blockchain, which makes them tamper-proof and secure.
